    "## 1. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it functions\n",
    "- **Cut into windows:** slice the EEG into short, overlapping chunks.\n",
    "- **Analyze each chunk:** for each slice, check which frequencies are present and how strong they are.\n",
    "- **Slide across time:** repeat for the next slice to build a movie of spectral content.\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** short slices = sharp timing but fuzzy frequency; long slices = sharp frequency but blurrier timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will see\n",
    "- A **spectrogram** (time on x-axis, frequency on y-axis, color = power).\n",
    "- In mental arithmetic: **alpha suppression (ERD)** over parietal areas and **theta increases** over frontal areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical knobs\n",
    "- **Window length:** typically 0.5–1.0 s for theta/alpha.\n",
    "- **Overlap:** 50–90% for smoothness.\n",
    "- **Window shape:** Hann/Hamming or multitaper to reduce leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths / Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Strengths:** simple, robust, reproducible; great for band-power and ERSP.\n",
    "- **Pitfalls:** wrong window choice can blur features or miss rapid changes; edges may distort results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it functions\n",
    "- **Zoom-lens idea:** wavelets auto-adjust—short for high frequencies, long for low.\n",
    "- **Pattern matching:** slide wave-shaped templates across the signal at different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will see\n",
    "- A **scalogram** (time vs. frequency power) that often looks smoother than STFT.\n",
    "- Clear detection of **transient bursts** (e.g., frontal theta bursts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical knobs\n",
    "- **Mother wavelet:** complex Morlet (standard for EEG).\n",
    "- **Frequency sampling:** ~2–45 Hz, with more detail at low frequencies.\n",
    "- **Cone of influence (COI):** edges are unreliable—ignore them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths / Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Strengths:** adapts naturally to EEG; excellent for phase metrics (ITPC).\n",
    "- **Pitfalls:** sensitive to parameter settings; must respect the COI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) & Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it functions\n",
    "- **Peeling an onion:** repeatedly extract oscillatory layers from fastest to slowest.\n",
    "- **Data-driven:** no pre-defined basis; the signal defines its own oscillations.\n",
    "- **Result:** a few IMFs, each representing a rhythm that can drift in frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is special\n",
    "- EEG rhythms wander (e.g., alpha shifting from 10.5 Hz to 9.7 Hz). EMD follows these drifts directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variants\n",
    "- **EEMD / CEEMDAN:** add tiny noise and average results to reduce mode mixing and improve stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will see\n",
    "- A stack of IMF signals: one looks “alpha-like,” another “theta-like,” each possibly drifting in frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths / Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Strengths:** captures amplitude and frequency modulation (AM–FM).\n",
    "- **Pitfalls:** end effects; possible mode mixing; IMFs vary by subject/session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Hilbert Transform & Hilbert--Huang Transform (HHT)\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Typically applied after obtaining IMFs via EMD)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it functions\n",
    "- **Wrap IMFs in an envelope:** Hilbert transform gives instantaneous amplitude and phase.\n",
    "- **Instantaneous frequency:** derived from the changing phase over time.\n",
    "- **HHT:** combine results across IMFs to form a full time–frequency picture that follows rhythms moment-to-moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will see\n",
    "- **Amplitude traces:** strength of oscillations (e.g., alpha, theta) over time.\n",
    "- **Instantaneous frequency traces:** whether rhythms drift up or down in frequency.\n",
    "- **Hilbert spectrum:** a TF map built from these dynamic quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths / Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Strengths:** unmatched for tracking frequency drift and detailed amplitude changes.\n",
    "- **Pitfalls:** unreliable when amplitude is very low; edge artifacts remain.\n"

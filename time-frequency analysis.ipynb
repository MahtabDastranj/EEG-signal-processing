    "## 1. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem with Standard Fourier Transform\n",
    "- The **Fourier Transform (FT)** assumes the signal is stationary.\n",
    "- For non-stationary signals (e.g., speech, EEG, music), FT hides **when** frequencies occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STFT: The Idea\n",
    "The **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** applies FT on **short overlapping windows** of the signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\[\n",
    "STFT\\{x(t)\\}(τ, f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)\\, w(t-τ) \\, e^{-j 2 \\pi f t}\\, dt\n",

    "- \\(x(t)\\): input signal  \n",
    "- \\(w(t)\\): window function (e.g., Hamming, Hann)  \n",
    "- \\(τ\\): window position in time  \n",
    "- \\(f\\): frequency  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- The window localizes the signal in time.  \n",
    "- For each window → compute FT.  \n",
    "- Stack results → **time–frequency representation**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off (Uncertainty Principle):**\n",
    "- Short window → good **time resolution**, poor frequency resolution.  \n",
    "- Long window → good **frequency resolution**, poor time resolution.  \n",

    "**Output:** A **spectrogram** (time on x-axis, frequency on y-axis, color = magnitude/power).\n",

    "## 2. Welch’s Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem with Periodogram\n",
    "- The **periodogram** estimates Power Spectral Density (PSD), but has **high variance**.  \n",
    "- Not reliable for short/finite data.  \n",

    "### Welch’s Method: The Idea\n",
    "Welch improves PSD estimation by **segmenting, windowing, and averaging**:\n",

    "1. Split the signal into overlapping segments.  \n",
    "2. Apply a window to each segment.  \n",
    "3. Compute the periodogram of each segment.  \n",
    "4. **Average** the results → smoother PSD estimate.  \n",

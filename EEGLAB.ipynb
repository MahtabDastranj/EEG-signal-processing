    "**How to understand whether there is an offset on the signal?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, after plotting the data, there's no displayed signal even by changing threshold. The reason is often because of high offset existence. For this approach, after plotting data, click on display, remove offset. \n",

    "\n",
    "**To remove offset from data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tools, remove epoch baseline (uses HPF): In this case, 2 options will pop up. The first one is channel types, which allows specific channel types to become excluded. For example, you have EEG, EOG, ECG and you choose which one to remove its offset. The second one allows us to choose between different channels. If you leave it unchanged, offset will be removed from all channels.\n",

    "2. Tools, filter the data, basic FIR filter\n",
    "  - Lower edge frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{cutoff}}$ for HPF. Frequencies above this will be passed.\n",

    "  - If both frequencies are written, the filter will be BPF.\n",
    "    - If notch option is selected, the filter will be Band stop filter (BSF).\n",

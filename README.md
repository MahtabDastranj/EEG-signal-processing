# EEG Signal Processing with EEGLAB

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that documents the essential steps in EEG signal processing using **EEGLAB**, a MATLAB toolbox widely used in neuroscience and biomedical engineering research.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Notebook

The notebook, [`EEGLAB.ipynb`](https://github.com/MahtabDastranj/EEG-signal-processing/blob/main/EEGLAB.ipynb), is a structured and detailed summary of key EEG preprocessing and analysis procedures such as:

* Data import and format conversion
* Filtering (high-pass, low-pass, notch)
* Artifact rejection and ICA
* Channel location setup
* Epoching and baseline correction
* Event-related potential (ERP) analysis
* Time-frequency decomposition

This guide is ideal for students, researchers, or anyone beginning their journey in EEG data analysis with EEGLAB.
